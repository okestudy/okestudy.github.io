                         The Cat and the Fox<br />Once a Cat and a Fox were traveling together. As they went along, picking up provisions on the way -- a stray mouse here, a fat chicken there -- they began an argument to while away the time between bites. And, as usually happens when comrades argue, the talk began to get personal.<br />"You think you are extremely clever, don't you?" said the Fox. "Do you pretend to know more than I? Why, I know a whole sackful of tricks!"<br /><br />"Well," retorted the Cat, "I admit I know one trick only, but that one, let me tell you, is worth a thousand of yours!"<br /><br />Just then, close by, they heard a hunter's horn and the yelping of a pack of hounds. In an instant the Cat was up a tree, hiding among the leaves.<br /><br />"This is my trick," he called to the Fox. "Now let me see what yours are worth."<br /><br />But the Fox had so many plans for escape he could not decide which one to try first. He dodged here and there with the hounds at his heels. He doubled on his tracks, he ran at top speed, he entered a dozen burrows, but all in vain. The hounds caught him, and soon put an end to the boaster and all his tricks.<br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>In a small river, a crane walked with such graceful steps. It stares at the very clear river water, and with its long neck and beak, it prepares to pounce on its prey in the water. The crane was very happy to look into the water, because that morning, lots of small fish were swimming. However, he arrogantly said to himself "Today I don't want to eat small fish," "I am a graceful crane, I shouldn't eat small fish in this river," said the stork arrogantly. The proud crane then waited for a bigger fish to come for him to prey on. Time passed, the day was getting longer and the proud crane was still waiting for the bigger fish. But when it was noon, the small fish on the banks of the river swam into the middle of the river. Until finally the proud crane no longer saw a single fish in the river, and forced him to prey on a small snail that was on the bank of the river. </p><br />

                        <strong>Malin Kundang<br /></strong>Near the mouth of the Batang Arau River there once was a large fishing
village. Its harbor was crowded with large ships and sailing vessels from all
corners of the world.
Among the many fishing families, there lived a poor fisherman and his wife
and son. Their only child was so spoiled that he was called Malin Kundang.
Malin was the boy’s name but Kundang meant spoiled.
<br /><br />(<strong>Malin Kundang</strong><br />Di dekat hilir sungai Batang Arau, terdapat satu desa nelayan. Pelabuhan yang sangat ramai dengan kapal-kapal besar yg berlabuh dari penjuru negeri. Di antara keluarga nelayan di sana, terdapat satu keluarga miskin dengan satu anak laki-lakinya. Anak laki-laki itu bernama Malin Kundang. Malin adalah nama untuk anak laki-laki, dan Kundang artinya 'pemarah'.)<br /><br />Malin Kundang was a naughty child. One day when he was playing too
roughly, he fell and wounded his forehead. It left a scar that clearly marked
the boy. Even when he was grown into a young man, the scar could plainly
be seen.
When Malin Kundang was a young man, he was so well-built and strong that
his father was able to secure a place for him with a sea captain.<br /><br />(Malin Kundang adalah anak yg nakal. Suatu hari saat dia bermain, keningnya terluka. Luka itu meninggalkan bekas yg nampak jelas. Bahkan hingga dia tumbuh besar, bekas luka tersebut tetap nampak di keningnya. Malin kundang dewasa adalah pemuda yg gagah dan kuat sehingga sang Ayah menitipkannya kepada seorang Kapten Kapal.)<br /> <br />“Dear sir, if
you need a crewman, please take my son with you. You may bring him up
and consider him as your own son. I hope he can learn much from you, sir,
and perhaps one day he can become a captain like yourself.”
The ship’s captain was willing to take Malin Kundang aboard, and Malin
Kundang was excited by the opportunity to see other countries.
<br /><br />("Tuan, jikalau engkau membutuhkan anakbuah, sudilah kiranya membawa anakku ini. Jadikan dia anakbuahmu dan anggaplah dia sebagai anakmu". Sang Kapten Kapal bersedia membawa Malin Kundang ke kapalnya, dan Malin Kundang amatlah senang akan kesempatannya melihat dunia luar.)<br /><br />It was hard for Malin Kundang’s parents to see him off at the port. They
watched until the ship disappeared from sight. Then they returned to their
little hut, only hoping that one day they would see their beloved son again.
<br />Day after day, week after week, year after year passed, Malin Kundang
worked diligently and learned a great deal. He made a fortune for himself.
He became a rich sea captain, with a large ship of his own. He married the
daughter of a wealthy merchant. <br /><br />(Saat itu adalah perpisahan yg sangat berat bagi orang tua Malin Kundang. Mereka melepas Malin Kundang hingga kapal berlayar menjauh dan menghilang dari pandangan. Lalu mereka kembali ke gubug mereka dengan harapan suatu saat nanti dapat berkumpul lagi.  Hari demi hari, minggu berganti dan tahun pun berlalu, Malin Kundang pintar dalam bekerja dan banyak belajar. Dia mendapat banyak keberuntungan. Dia pun menjadi seorang Kapten Kapal yg kaya, dengan kapal besar miliknya sendiri. Dia juga menikahi seorang gadis, anak dari seorang saudagar kaya.)<br /><br />He completely forgot his own village and
his loving parents who still waited for his return.
Years passed and his parents grew older and older. His father died, but his
old mother still waited. She hoped to see her son once more.
Eventually Malin Kundang did begin to think of his old village and so he
decided to visit it. He had never told his wife of his village for fear she would
not like a man of such poor birth.
When his large ship arrived in the harbour of Batang Arau the villagers all
rushed to see the wonderful sight. “Who could be the owner of the rich
ship?” they asked each other.
<br /><br />(Dia telah lupa akan kampung dan orang tuanya yg masih menunggunya pulang. Tahun pun berlalu sehingga orang tuanya menjadi sangat renta. Ayahnya pun meninggal dunia, tetapi sang Ibu masih mengharapkan anaknya kembali pulang. Dia berharap dapat bertemu dengan anaknya sekali saja. Dan kebetulan Malin Kundang pun teringat akan kampung halamannya dan dia berencana untuk datang ke sana. Dia tidak pernah bercerita tentang desanya kepada sang istri karena khawatir istrinya akan mencelanya karena dulunya hanya anak nelayan miskin. Ketika kapalnya merapat di pelabuhan sungai Batang Arau, penduduk desa pun terperanjat dengan pemandangan yg mereka lihat. "Siapa kiranya pemilik dari kapal besar yg megah ini", mereka saling bertanya.)<br /><br />

                        beauty and the beast<br /><br /><br />Once upon a time as a merchant set off for market, he asked each of his three daughters what she would like as a present on his return. The first daughter wanted a brocade dress, the second a pearl necklace, but the third, whose name was Beauty, the youngest, prettiest and sweetest of them all, said to her father:  <br /><br /> "All I'd like is a rose you've picked specially for me!"   <br /><br /><br />When the merchant had finished his business, he set off for home. However, a sudden storm blew up, and his horse could hardly make headway in the howling gale. Cold and weary, the merchant had lost all hope of reaching an inn when he suddenly noticed a bright light shining in the middle of a wood. As he drew near, he saw that it was a castle, bathed in light.   <br /><br />"I hope I'll find shelter there for the night," he said to himself. <br /><br /><br />When he reached the door, he saw it was open, but though he shouted, nobody came to greet him. Plucking up courage, he went inside, still calling out to attract attention. On a table in the main hall, a splendid dinner lay already served. The merchant lingered, still shouting for the owner of the castle. But no one came, and so the starving merchant sat down to a hearty meal.  <br />Overcome by curiosity, he ventured upstairs, where the corridor led into magnificent rooms and halls. A fire crackled in the first room and a soft bed looked very inviting. It was now late, and the merchant could not resist. He lay down on the bed and fell fast asleep. <br /><br /><br />When he woke next morning, an unknown hand had placed a mug of steaming coffee and some fruit by his bedside. The merchant had breakfast and after tidying himself up, went downstairs to thank his generous host. But, as on the evening before, there was nobody in sight. Shaking his head in wonder at the strangeness of it all, he went towards the garden where he had left his horse, tethered to a tree. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Suddenly, a large rose bush caught his eye. Remembering his promise to Beauty, he bent down to pick a rose. Instantly, out of the rose garden, sprang a horrible beast, wearing splendid clothes. Two bloodshot eyes, gleaming angrily, glared at him and a deep, terrifying voice growled: <br /><br /><br />"Ungrateful man! I gave you shelter, you ate at my table and slept in my own bed, but now all the thanks I get is the theft of my favorite flowers! I shall put you to death for this slight!" <br /><br /><br />Trembling with fear, the merchant fell on his knees before the Beast.  "Forgive me! Forgive me! Don't kill me! I'll do anything you say! The rose wasn't for me, it was for my daughter Beauty. I promised to bring her back a rose from my journey!" <br /><br /><br />The Beast dropped the paw it had clamped on the unhappy merchant.   <br /><br /><br />"I shall spare your life, but on one condition, that you bring me your daughter!" The terror-stricken merchant, faced with certain death if he did not obey, promised that he would do so. When he reached home in tears, his three daughters ran to greet him. After he had told them of his dreadful adventure, Beauty put his mind at rest immediately.<br /><br /> <br />"Dear father, I'd do anything for you! Don't worry, you'll be able to keep your promise and save your life! Take me to the castle. I'll stay there in your place!" The merchant hugged his daughter.  <br /><br /><br />"I never did doubt your love for me. For the moment I can only thank you for saving my life." So Beauty was led to the castle. The Beast, however, had quite an unexpected greeting for the girl. Instead of menacing doom as it had done with her father, it was surprisingly pleasant.  <br /><br />In the beginning, Beauty was frightened of the Beast, and shuddered at the sight of it. Then she found that, in spite of the monster's awful head, her horror of it was gradually fading as time went by. <br /><br /><br />She had one of the finest rooms in the Castle, and sat for hours, embroidering in front of the fire. And the Beast would sit, for hours on end, only a short distance away, silently gazing at her. Then it started to say a few kind words, till in the end, Beauty was amazed to discover that she was actually enjoying its conversation. The days passed, and Beauty and the Beast became good friends. <br /><br />￼<br /><br /><br />Then one day, the Beast asked the girl to be his wife.  Taken by surprise, Beauty did not know what to say. Marry such an ugly monster? She would rather die! But she did not want to  hurt the feelings of one who, after all, had been kind to her. And she remembered too that she owed it her own life as well as her father's.   <br /><br /><br />"I really can't say yes," she began shakily. "I'd so much like to..." The Beast interrupted her with an abrupt gesture.   <br /><br /><br />"I quite understand! And I'm not offended by your refusal!" Life went on as usual, and nothing further was said. <br /><br /><br />One day, the Beast presented Beauty with a magnificent magic mirror. When Beauty peeped into it, she could see her family, far away.   <br /><br /><br />"You won't feel so lonely now," were the words that accompanied the gift. Beauty stared for hours at her distant family. Then she began to feel worried. One day, the Beast found her weeping beside the magic mirror.   <br /><br />. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />-The Fox and The Crow-<br /><br />Eventually there was a fox that saw a Crow flying off with an item of cheese in its beak as well as clear up pleasantly on a branch of a tree.<br />” That’s my food, because I am a Fox,” Master Reynard stated, while he was mosting likely to the foot of the tree.<br />” Good day, Girlfriend Crow,” he welcomed. “Just how gorgeous you are looking today: how shiny your softy plumes; exactly how brilliant your eagle eye. I feel certain your voice must surpass that of various other birds, just as your number does; allow me take pleasure in one tune from you that I may greet you as the Queen of Birds.”<br />The Crow lifted up her head and also croaked her ideal, but the minute she opened her mouth the item of cheese dropped to the ground, and directly got by Master Fox.<br />” That will certainly do,” he said. “That was all I actually desired. As the substitution for your cheese I will give you an item of sensible suggestions for the future: “Do not depend on phonies."<br />

Once upon a time there were a great empire on the island of Halmahera. 
King had recently died. He left two sons and one daughter. They named 
Majesty Arif, son Binaut Majesty and Majesty Princess Nuri. Binaut 
king’s sons really wanted the position as king to succeed his father. 
The desire was conveyed to the royal governor. “I had to replace the 
position of my father.” Said Binaut to the duke with confidence.

emaciated because during incarceration in the basement rarely eat and 
drink. Wise also convey to Your Majesty the Queen will hold the attack

stuck. Immediately his feet blistered and peeling skin. He tried to not 
stop running. Hot lava began to creep into his body. He was tortured. 
When he suffered torture hot lava that he remembers his mother. He 
begged forgiveness. “Forgive me, Mom! Excuse me, ma’am! I can not endure
 this suffering! I will not betray my mother, brother and sister Arif 
Nuri again. Please forgive me! Mom! Mom! “Shouted Binaut pain. But the 
cry is lost slowly and eventually he died.

<br />

into a cape. That said, the cape was often heard people crying for mercy
 because they suffered extreme torture. Now the place was called the

Selain itu, seorang yang kikir ini juga memiliki beberapa pekerjaan sampingan yang menjadi salah satu tambahan penghasilan bulanan di samping penghasilan utamanya. Akan tetapi, dia sangat terkenal sebagai seorang yang kikir dan sama sekali tidak mau membantu tetangganya yang membutuhkan.Dia memiliki hobi untuk menyimpan kekayaannya. Sebagaimana di ceritakan oleh orang tua jaman dahulu, menyimpan kekayaan dalam bentuk emas tentu sangat mengutungkan karena harga emas semakin lama akan semakin tinggi. Oleh karena itu, seorang yang kikir ini membeli emas sebanyak yang dia bisa dan menyimpannya di sebuah lubang yang di buat di belakang rumah.
</p><p>
</p><p>Setiap hari, dia melihat dan memastikan keamanan dari emas yang dia simpan. Dia membuka kunci lubang tersebut dan memandangi emas yang dia kumpulkan, sebagai koleksinya. Terkadang, dia merasa senang karena dia memiliki simpanan untuk hidup yang lebih baik di masa depan. Akan tetapi, dia juga merasa sedih karena emas yang di kumpulkan baru sedikit dan dia ingin menambah lagi koleksinya.
</p><p>
</p><p>Suatu hari, seseorang melihat apa yang dia kerjakan. Orang tsb mencoba mencari tahu tentang letak si kikir menyembunyikan emas di belakang rumahnya. Setelah mengetahui letak dari emas yang di sembunyikan, seseorang tadi pulang untuk mengatur rencana.Hari itu sore yang sangat cerah ketika si kikir keluar dari rumahnya. Dia hendak menuju ke kota untuk membeli emas yang baru dan menambah koleksinya. Akan tetapi, setelah mengetahui bahwa si kikir pergi dari rumah, seseorang yang mengetahui tentang harta simpanan tsb ternyata sudah berada di dekat rumahnya. Langsung saja ketika dia mengerti bahwa rumah telah sepi, dia berlari kebelakang rumah dan mencoba membuka brankas penyimpanan.
</p><p>
</p><p>Setelah mendapatkan apa yang dia cari, seseorang tadi pergi. Baru ketika malam menjelang si kikir pulang dan betapa kagetnya dia ketika melihat apa yang dia simpan telah raib.
</p><p>
</p><p>“Tolong. Seseorang mencuri hartaku, kata si kikirBeberapa tetangga berlarian menghampiri dan salah satu dari mereka berkata, “harta dan kekayaan yang kau simpan tidak berguna. Mungkin sekarang itu akan berguna untuk orang lain”</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>may be useful</p><p>give me good answer and star</p><br />

                        The legend of The Flying Dutchman started in 1641 when a Dutch ship sank off the coast of the Cape of Good Hope. The captain, Van der Decken failed to notice the dark clouds looming and only when he heard the lookout scream out in terror, did he realise that they had sailed straight into a fierce storm.The captain and his crew battled for hours to get out of the storm and at one stage it looked like they would make it. Then they heard a sickening crunch – the ship had hit treacherous rocks and began to sink. As the ship plunged downwards, Captain VandeDecken knew that death was approaching. He was not ready to die and screamed out a curse: “I WILL round this Cape even if I have to keep sailing until doomsday!”So, even today whenever a storm brews off the Cape of Good Hope, if you look into the eye of the storm, you will be able to see the ship and its captain – The Flying Dutchman. The legend goes that whoever sees the ship will die a terrible death.Many people have claimed to have seen The Flying Dutchman, including the crew of a German submarine boat during World War II.On 11 July 1881, the Royal Navy ship, the Bacchante was rounding the tip of Africa, when they were confronted with the sight of The Flying Dutchman. The midshipman, a prince who later became King George V, recorded that the lookout man and the officer of the watch had seen the Flying Dutchman and he used these words to describe the ship:“A strange red light as of a phantom ship all aglow, in the midst of which light the mast, spars and sails of a brig 200 yards distant stood out in strong relief.”It’s pity that the lookout saw the Flying Dutchman, for soon after on the same trip, he accidentally fell from a mast and died. Fortunately for the English royal family, the young midshipman survived the curse.The Flying Dutchman appeared as the ghost ship in the movie Pirates of the Caribbean.It’s also featured in the novel “Castaways of the Flying Dutchman” by Brian Jacques.<br />

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>A Town Mouse and A Country Mouse
</p><p>
</p><p>
A Town Mouse and a Country Mouse were friends. The Country Mouse one day invited his friend to come and see him at his home in the fields. The Town Mouse came and they sat down to a dinner of barleycorns and roots the latter of which had a distinctly earthy flavour.
</p><p>
The flavour was not much to the taste of the guest and presently he broke out with “My poor dear friend, you live here no better than the ants. Now, you should just see how I fare! My larder is a regular horn of plenty. You must come and stay with me and I promise you shall live on the fat of the land."
</p><p>
So when he returned to town he took the Country Mouse with him and showed him into a larder containing flour and oatmeal and figs and honey and dates.
</p><p>
The Country Mouse had never seen anything like it and sat down to enjoy the luxuries his friend provided. But before they had well begun, the door of the larder opened and some one came in. The two Mice scampered off and hid themselves in a narrow and exceedingly uncomfortable hole. Presently, when all was quiet, they ventured out again. But some one else came in, and off they scuttled again. This was too much for the visitor. "Good bye," said he, "I'm off. You live in the lap of luxury, I can see, but you are surrounded by dangers whereas at home I can enjoy my simple dinner of roots and corn in peace."
</p><p>
Moral : Safety is the first importance.</p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p>Tikus Kota dan Tikus Desa</p><p></p><p></p><p>Tikus Kota dan Tikus Desa berteman. Tikus Desa suatu hari mengundang temannya untuk datang dan melihatnya di rumahnya di ladang. Tikus Kota datang dan mereka duduk untuk makan malam dengan barleycorn dan akar yang memiliki rasa yang sangat bersahaja.</p><p></p><p>Rasanya tidak terlalu sesuai dengan selera tamu dan saat ini dia berkata, “Sahabatku yang malang, kamu tinggal di sini tidak lebih baik dari semut. Sekarang, Anda hanya harus melihat bagaimana saya tarif! Lemari makan saya adalah tanduk biasa yang berlimpah. Kamu harus datang dan tinggal bersamaku dan aku berjanji kamu akan hidup di atas tanah yang lembek."</p><p></p><p>Jadi ketika dia kembali ke kota, dia membawa Tikus Pedesaan bersamanya dan menunjukkan padanya ke dalam lemari yang berisi tepung dan oatmeal, buah ara, madu, dan kurma.</p><p></p><p>Tikus Pedesaan belum pernah melihat yang seperti itu dan duduk untuk menikmati kemewahan yang disediakan temannya. Tapi sebelum mereka mulai dengan baik, pintu lemari makanan terbuka dan seseorang masuk. Kedua Tikus itu lari dan bersembunyi di lubang sempit dan sangat tidak nyaman. Saat ini, ketika semuanya tenang, mereka memberanikan diri keluar lagi. Tapi ada orang lain yang masuk, dan mereka kabur lagi. Ini terlalu banyak untuk pengunjung. "Selamat tinggal," katanya, "aku pergi. Kamu hidup di pangkuan kemewahan, aku bisa melihat, tetapi kamu dikelilingi oleh bahaya sedangkan di rumah aku bisa menikmati makan malam sederhana dari akar dan jagung dengan tenang."</p><p></p><p>Moral : Keselamatan adalah yang utama.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>jack si pemalas</p><p></p><p>Once upon a time there was a boy whose name was Jack, and he lived with his mother on a common. They were very poor, and the old woman got her living by spinning, but Jack was so lazy that he would do nothing but bask in the sun in the hot weather, and sit by the corner of the hearth in the winter-time. So they called him Lazy Jack. His mother could not get him to do anything for her, and at last told him, one Monday, that if he did not begin to work for his porridge she would turn him out to get his living as he could.</p><p></p><p>This roused Jack, and he went out and hired himself for the next day to a neighbouring farmer for a penny; but as he was coming home, never having had any money before, he lost it in passing over a brook. "You stupid boy," said his mother, "you should have put it in your pocket." "I’ll do so another time," replied Jack.</p><p></p><p>On Wednesday, Jack went out again and hired himself to a cow-keeper, who gave him a jar of milk for his day’s work. Jack took the jar and put it into the large pocket of his jacket, spilling it all, long before he got home. "Dear me!" said the old woman; "you should have carried it on your head." "I’ll do so another time," said Jack.</p><p></p><p>So on Thursday, Jack hired himself again to a farmer, who agreed to give him a cream cheese for his services. In the evening Jack took the cheese, and went home with it on his head. By the time he got home the cheese was all spoilt, part of it being lost, and part matted with his hair. "You stupid lout," said his mother, "you should have carried it very carefully in your hands." "I’ll do so another time," replied Jack.</p><p></p><p></p><p>On Friday, Lazy Jack again went out, and hired himself to a baker, who would give him nothing for his work but a large tom-cat. Jack took the cat, and began carrying it very carefully in his hands, but in a short time pussy scratched him so much that he was compelled to let it go. When he got home, his mother said to him, "You silly fellow, you should have tied it with a string, and dragged it along after you." "I’ll do so another time," said Jack.</p><p></p><p>So on Saturday, Jack hired himself to a butcher, who rewarded him by the handsome present of a shoulder of mutton. Jack took the mutton, tied it to a string, and trailed it along after him in the dirt, so that by the time he had got home the meat was completely spoilt. His mother was this time quite out of patience with him, for the next day was Sunday, and she was obliged to make do with cabbage for her dinner. "You ninney-hammer," said she to her son; "you should have carried it on your shoulder." "I’ll do so another time," replied Jack.</p><p></p><p>On the next Monday, Lazy Jack went once more, and hired himself to a cattle-keeper, who gave him a donkey for his trouble. Jack found it hard to hoist the donkey on his shoulders, but at last he did it, and began walking slowly home with his prize. Now it happened that in the course of his journey there lived a rich man with his only daughter, a beautiful girl, but deaf and dumb. Now she had never laughed in her life, and the doctors said she would never speak till somebody made her laugh. This young lady happened to be looking out of the window when Jack was passing with the donkey on his shoulders, with the legs sticking up in the air, and the sight was so comical and strange that she burst out into a great fit of laughter, and immediately recovered her speech and hearing. Her father was overjoyed, and fulfilled his promise by marrying her to Lazy Jack, who was thus made a rich gentleman. They lived in a large house, and Jack’s mother lived with them in great happiness until she died.</p><br />

                        <p>Jawaban: ini about </p><p></p><p>Penjelasan:</p><p></p><p>                                  Fairytale: Ape of the Deceiver</p><p>In a forest with thick trees and green leaves, a crane is walking on its long legs into a river, to catch fish and frogs.
</p><p>
</p><p>Frog, is a stork's favorite food. Storks have a close friend in the forest called apes, they help each other. The crane likes to search for the apes' fleas, and takes the apes flying far away.
</p><p>
</p><p>Its wide wings, long legs and long neck Stork still uses it for long trips. Due to the wide and strong wings, the Ape is getting more and more pleased with the crane. But he never helped or returned the stork.
</p><p>
</p><p>Apes are always cunning and betrayal wants it themselves. At that time the two of them took a walk looking for food for the two of them, Stork had not yet realized that the monkey was cunning and tricked him.
</p><p>
</p><p>Advertisements
</p><p>
</p><p>"Stork, you want to eat fish and frogs don't you?" asked the monkey. The crane that was picking up a falling pear with its beak turned and nodded.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Poor thing, then you're looking for lots of fish and frogs, and I'm taking bananas and other fruits," said the monkey.
</p><p>
</p><p>"You're right, monkey. Yes, I have to say goodbye to the cranes who are absorbed in going to the river.
</p><p>
</p><p>Even monkeys who are good at climbing can pick up fruits quickly, gather grapes, apples, pears, bananas, and lychees and put them under the rambutan tree, where they both promised.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Stork, stork, you just want to be cheated by me, Hihihi," the monkey chuckled and then ate a piece of banana.
</p><p>
</p><p>Stork also found a lot of fish and frogs, but he was surprised that the fruit for the two of them had been exhausted, the monkey even took one fish and then burned it on a hot rock.
</p><p>
</p><p>Advertisements
</p><p>
</p><p>"Where are the fruits?" asked the crane, surprised. He also did not think that the monkey cheated him. In fact, monkeys also take their rations.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Stork, today my leg hurts. Earlier I only got a few pieces so I ate it because you took so long," said the monkey lying.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Poor thing, let's assault the food," said the crane, pitying. This is the third time he was cheated by an ape.
</p><p>
</p><p>But after the incident the second time, Stork certainly hurt. But he did not want to break the relationship. Apes store a lot of food, and the rest is only for cranes.
</p><p>
</p><p>The day after tomorrow, the monkey wants to cheat herons again, he wants to go to the island of Medang. There is no way anyone would permit a monkey to lend a boat. Besides today the heron is having a hard time finding food, because lately the river has run dry.
</p><p>
</p><p>TOK! TOK! TOK!
</p><p>
</p><p>The monkey knocked on the door of the crane's tree house that lives alone. Stork is waking up, because monkeys are too quick to stork deliver to the island of Medang.
</p><p>
</p><p>Advertisements
</p><p>
</p><p>"Oh, good morning monkey." he said, rubbing his eyes that were still sleepy.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Morning cranes too!" reply monkey.
</p><p>
</p><p>"What's up, monkey? Are you like that impatient? Do you want to play with me?" asked the stork repeatedly.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Stork, I want you to take me to the island of Medang. There are a lot of frogs, you know, and I'm looking for sapodilla," the ape tricked the crane to get ready.
</p><p>

</p><p>
</p><p>"Okay, let's go stork!" commanded the monkey while riding on the back of the crane.
</p><p>
</p><p>The stork flaps its wide wings towards the island of Medang. Along the way babbling jokes and jokes make the crane could not concentrate. Medang Island is very far, but for the sake of the cranes.
</p><p>
</p><p>Stork was exhausted, his energy was only 5 percent. They arrived at their destination. Stork lay sandy with fatigue. Apes are absorbed in the abundance of sapodilla.
</p><p>
</p><p>The monkey has slept, his stomach turned blue. After the crane looks for frogs, he doesn't find them until the monkeys wake up.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Stork, are you full?" asked the monkey mocker.
</p><p>
</p><p>"The monkey, you are full here. Food is abundant. The frog and grasshopper that you promised is not here. Therefore, I cannot stay here. I will return to my hometown." Said the Crane.
</p><p>
</p><p>With the abundant sapodilla here, you can live seven generations. Therefore, tomorrow I will go home. I am going to tell the ape citizens about your sapodilla forest. "Then the crane realized that he had been tricked.
</p><p>
</p><p>Suddenly the monkey was nervous. "Don't be like that," said the monkey. "I can't live here alone."
</p><p>
</p><p>"But I can't live without a frog, can I?"
</p><p>
</p><p>Stork also felt hurt. He also replied to the monkey's tricks.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Then fine. Let's fly me back to the village with you," said the monkey. "Sorry the monkey, my wings have not fully recovered to be able to fly with your body weight. Never mind flying with the monkey. Flying alone is not necessarily strong."
</p><p>
</p><p>"Then we just wait until you regain strength." The crane answered,
</p><p>
</p><p>"How could I have to wait. What should I eat? Do I have to starve here while you have an abundance of sapodilla fruit? I think you can go home alone by boat. Ka</p><br />
