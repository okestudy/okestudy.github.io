You can mix pleasure with learning when you listen to a song and exploit the song as a means to your English progress. Some underlying reason can be drawn to support the idea why we use songs in language learning.Firstly, “the song stuck in my head” Phenomenon (the echoing in our minds of the last song we heard after leaving a restaurant, shopping malls, etc) can be both enjoyable and sometimes unnerving. This phenomenon also seems to reinforce the idea that songs work on our short-and-long term memory.Secondly, songs in general also use simple conversational language, with a lot of repetition, which is just what many learners look for sample text. The fact that they are effective makes them many times more motivating than other text. Although usually simple, some songs can be quite complex syntactically, lexically and poetically, and can be analyzed in the same way as any other literary sample. Furthermore, song can be appropriated by listener for their own purpose. Most pop songs and probably many other types don’t have precise people, place or time reference. In addition, songs are relaxing. They provide variety and fun, and encourage harmony within oneself and within one group. Little wonder they are important tools in sustaining culture, religion, patriotism and yeas, even revolution.Last but not least, there are many learning activities we can do with songs such as studying grammar, practicing selective listening comprehension, translating songs, learning vocabulary, spelling and culture.From the elaboration above, it can be concluded that learning through music and songs, learning English can be enjoyable and fun.​</a>

Some underlying reason can be drawn to support the idea why we use songs in language learning.     Firstly, “the song stuck in my head” Phenomenon (the echoing in our minds of the last song we heard after leaving a restaurant, shopping malls, etc) can be both enjoyable and sometimes unnerving. This phenomenon also seems to reinforce the idea that songs work on our short-and-long term memory.     Secondly, songs in general also use simple conversational language, with a lot of repetition, which is just what many learners look for sample text. The fact that they are effective makes them many times more motivating than other text. Although usually simple, some songs can be quite complex syntactically, lexically and poetically, and can be analyzed in the same way as any other literary sample.     Furthermore, song can be appropriated by listener for their own purpose. Most pop songs and probably many other types don’t have precise people, place or time reference.In addition, songs are relaxing. They provide variety and fun, and encourage harmony within oneself and within one group. Little wonder they are important tools in sustaining culture, religion, patriotism and yeas, even revolution.     Last but not least, there are many learning activities we can do with songs such as studying grammar, practicing selective listening comprehension, translating songs, learning vocabulary, spelling and culture.From the elaboration above, it can be concluded that learning through music and songs, learning English can be enjoyable and fun.8.

Learning English through music and songs can be very enjoyable. You can mix pleasure with learning when you listen to a song and exploit the song as a means to your English progress. Some underlying reason can be drawn to support the idea why we use songs in language learning. Firstly, "the song stuck in my head" Phenomenon (the echoing in our minds of the last song we heard after leaving a restaurant, shopping malls, etc) can be both enjoyable and sometimes unnerving. This phenomenon also seems to reinforce the idea that songs work on our short-and-long term memory. Secondly, songs in general also use simple conversational language, with a lot of repetition, which is just what many learners look for sample text. The fact that they are effective makes them many times more motivating than other text. Although usually simple, some songs can be quite complex syntactically, lexically and poetically, and can be analyzed in the same way as any other literary sample. Furthermore, song can be appropriated by listener for their own purpose. Most pop songs and probably many other types don’t have precise people, place or time reference. In addition, songs are relaxing. They provide variety and fun, and encourage harmony within oneself and within one group. Little wonder they are important tools in sustaining culture, religion, patriotism and yeas, even revolution. Last but not least, there are many learning activities we can do with songs such as studying grammar, practicing selective listening comprehension, translating songs, learning vocabulary, spelling and culture. From the elaboration above, it can be concluded that learning through music and songs, learning English can be enjoyable and fun

                        <p>Jawaban:Belajar bahasa Inggris</p><p>Belajar bahasa Inggris melalui musik dan lagu bisa sangat menyenangkan. Anda dapat menggabungkan kesenangan dengan belajar saat Anda mendengarkan lagu dan memanfaatkan lagu tersebut sebagai alat untuk kemajuan bahasa Inggris Anda. Beberapa alasan yang mendasari dapat ditarik untuk mendukung gagasan mengapa kami menggunakan lagu dalam pembelajaran bahasa.</p><p></p><p>Pertama, Fenomena “lagu terjebak di kepala saya” (bergema di benak kita tentang lagu terakhir yang kita dengar setelah meninggalkan restoran, pusat perbelanjaan, dll) bisa menyenangkan dan terkadang menakutkan. Fenomena ini juga tampaknya memperkuat gagasan bahwa lagu bekerja pada ingatan jangka pendek dan jangka panjang kita.</p><p></p><p>Kedua, lagu pada umumnya juga menggunakan bahasa percakapan sederhana, dengan banyak pengulangan, itulah yang dicari oleh banyak pelajar untuk contoh teks. Fakta bahwa mereka efektif membuat mereka berkali-kali lebih memotivasi daripada teks lainnya. Meskipun biasanya sederhana, beberapa lagu dapat menjadi sangat kompleks secara sintaksis, leksikal dan puitis, dan dapat dianalisis dengan cara yang sama seperti sampel sastra lainnya.</p><p></p><p>Lagipula, lagu dapat disesuaikan oleh pendengar untuk kepentingannya sendiri. Kebanyakan lagu pop dan mungkin banyak jenis lainnya tidak memiliki referensi orang, tempat, atau waktu yang tepat. Selain itu, lagu juga membuat santai. Mereka memberikan variasi dan kesenangan, dan mendorong harmoni dalam diri sendiri dan dalam satu kelompok. Tidak heran mereka adalah alat penting dalam melestarikan budaya, agama, patriotisme, dan yeas, bahkan revolusi.</p><p></p><p>Last but not least, ada banyak kegiatan belajar yang bisa kita lakukan dengan lagu seperti belajar tata bahasa, berlatih pemahaman mendengar selektif, menerjemahkan lagu, belajar kosakata, ejaan dan budaya.</p><p></p><p>Dari uraian di atas, dapat disimpulkan bahwa belajar melalui musik dan lagu, belajar bahasa Inggris bisa menyenangkan dan menyenangkan</p><p>Maaf kalo salah</p><p></p><br />

This phenomenon also seems to reinforce the idea that songs work on our short-and-long term memory.Secondly, songs in general also use simple conversational language, with a lot of repetition, which is just what many learners look for sample text. The fact that they are effective makes them many times more motivating than other text. Although usually simple, some songs can be quite complex syntactically, lexically and poetically, and can be analyzed in the same way as any other literary samplE.Furthermore, song can be appropriated by listener for their own purposE. Most pop songs and probably many other types don’t have precise people, place or time referencE.In addition, songs are relaxing. They provide variety and fun, and encourage harmony within oneself and within one group. Little wonder they are important tools in sustaining culture, religion, patriotism and yeas, even revolution.Last but not least, there are many learning activities we can do with songs such as studying grammar, practicing selective listening comprehension, translating songs, learning vocabulary, spelling and culturE.From the elaboration above, it can be concluded that learning through music and songs, learning English can be enjoyable and fun.11.The type of the text above is ………A.

Furthermore, song can be appropriated by listener for their own purpose. Most pop songs and probably many other types don’t have precise people, place or time reference.
